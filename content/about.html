<h2 class="subtitle"> An Urgent Need for Child Protective Measures </h2>

<div class="article is-size-6">
<p> Online sexual exploitation of children is a form of sex trafficking causing great harm to the very young. 73% of the victims rescued in International Justice Mission (IJM) supported cases under this crime type are children and around 50% of these victims are aged 12 years old and below. </p>
<br>

<p> Upon rescue, survivors are often required to recount experiences of sexual abuse in multiple interviews conducted by law enforcers, social workers, and other caseworkers. This can be very distressing to survivors. In IJM-supported OSEC cases where over 74% of the perpetrators are parents, members, and close family friends, caseworkers have witnessed how testifying against once-trusted adults can be traumatic for a child.</p>
<br>
<p> The law provides several measures to protect children from this re-traumatization and re-victimization. One of these measures is the Videotaped In-Depth Interview (VIDI) - a video recorded “inquiry or proceeding conducted by duly trained members of a multidisciplinary team or representatives of law enforcement or child protective services for the purpose of determining whether child abuse has been committed.” VIDIs, when conducted and recorded properly, is admissible as evidence as it can be presented in lieu of live victim testimony during trial. As it is intended to serve as evidence, it takes on the nature of a child forensic interview. </p>
  
IJM has been working with justice system partners to mainstream this prosecution strategy. In our collaborative casework to combat OSEC, we have seen increased utilization of VIDIs in Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao.
<br>
<br>
<p> In 2020, the pandemic resulted in the limitation of movement worldwide. Data have shown, however, that the resulting lockdowns led to the increase of online sexual exploitation. Corollarily, rescue operations are still ongoing. This highlights the fervent need to continually build the capacity of the caseworks in conducting VIDIs. Justice procedures are now transitioned online, which makes VIDI all the more relevant. </p>
<br>
<p> This training seeks to increase the capacity of caseworkers and frontliners handling cases of online sexual exploitation of children who are qualified to conduct VIDIs under the law – social workers and police officers. That way, that they perform their tasks from the lens of child protection and in manner that complies with evidentiary standards under the law. The overall design of the training curriculum seeks to upskill the caseworkers in two main areas: (1) conducting a child forensic interview and (2) videocapturing the interview. </p>
<br>
<p> However, with 2021 still being a year of uncertainty for in-person trainings, this training will adopt innovative training methods and established learning principles utilizing online solutions. A learning management system that is both self-paced and interactive will be utilized. </p>
